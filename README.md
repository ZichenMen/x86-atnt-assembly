# assembly-practice
The programs in this repository serve as exercises for understanding how to interact directly with the CPU and the operating system at the machine level. Each program is a standalone example showcasing different aspects of assembly language programming, such as input/output operations, control flow, and basic subroutine calls.

# Usage
To run these programs on a Linux system, you'll need to have an assembler like GNU Assembler(as) and compiler(gcc) for linking. 
```
as -o program.o program.asm
```
